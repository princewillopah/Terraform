/*

The backend.tf file in Terraform configures the backend that Terraform uses to store the state file. Here's a breakdown of the backend.tf configuration you provided:

backend "s3"
This block configures Terraform to use an S3 bucket as the backend to store the Terraform state file. The state file keeps track of infrastructure resources created by Terraform. Storing it in S3 provides durability, availability, and the ability for multiple people to collaborate.

Breakdown of each line in the backend "s3" block:
bucket = "my-ews-baket1"

Specifies the name of the S3 bucket where Terraform will store the state file. In this case, it's "my-ews-baket1". You'll need to make sure this bucket already exists in your AWS account.
region = "us-east-1"

Defines the AWS region where the S3 bucket is located. Here, itâ€™s set to "us-east-1" (Northern Virginia).
key = "End-to-End-Kubernetes-Three-Tier-DevSecOps-Project/Jenkins-Server-TF/terraform.tfstate"

This is the file path within the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state file. The state file will be stored at:
End-to-End-Kubernetes-Three-Tier-DevSecOps-Project/Jenkins-Server-TF/terraform.tfstate
It organizes the state file into a specific directory, useful for complex projects with multiple environments.
dynamodb_table = "Lock-Files"

Specifies the DynamoDB table used for state locking. Terraform uses state locking to prevent multiple users from making changes to the state simultaneously. The table "Lock-Files" is used to store lock data to ensure only one user can make changes at a time.
encrypt = true

Enables server-side encryption for the state file stored in the S3 bucket. This ensures that the state file is encrypted at rest, protecting sensitive data like access keys, IP addresses, etc.
required_version = ">=0.13.0"
Specifies the minimum required version of Terraform for this configuration to work. It enforces that anyone working on this project uses Terraform version 0.13.0 or higher.
required_providers
Specifies the required provider(s) for the Terraform configuration. In this case, it ensures that the aws provider is used, and it must be version 2.7.0 or higher. It also specifies that the provider source is from HashiCorp (source = "hashicorp/aws").
Breakdown:
aws = {}

Defines that the AWS provider is required.
version = ">= 2.7.0"

Specifies that the AWS provider version should be 2.7.0 or higher.
source = "hashicorp/aws"

Specifies that the AWS provider comes from HashiCorp's official provider registry.

Summary:
This backend.tf file configures Terraform to use AWS S3 for storing the state file, DynamoDB for state locking, and ensures that users are running Terraform version 0.13.0 or later with the AWS provider (version 2.7.0 or higher). This configuration is critical for collaborating in a cloud environment and ensuring consistent state management.
